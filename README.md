# Chess Bot  
This repository contains a Chess Bot implemented in Python using various algorithms for making moves in a game of chess. The bot supports three different algorithms:  
1. **MiniMax**: A classic adversarial search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, transposition tables and multithreadding functionality.
2. **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)**: A tree search algorithm that uses random simulations to find the best move.
3. **Random**: A simple algorithm that selects a random legal move.
